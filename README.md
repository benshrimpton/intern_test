* Clone the repo

* Write all your code on the DOC

# Do these 2 tasks

* CSS : Turn the square div into a TRIANGLE - doesnt matter how big or small or which way it faces, it just needs to be a TRINAGLE with a BLACK background.

* JQUERY TEST : Type into the text field, when you click the button, write the value of the text field to the `#response` div.

# When finished

* Push your branch to GITHUB.
