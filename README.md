* Clone the repo

* Write all your code on the `index.html` do not add more files.

* CSS : Turn the square div into a TRIANGLE - doesnt matter how big or small or which way it faces, it just needs to be a TRIANGLE with a BLACK background.

* JAVASCRIPT TEST : Type into the text field, when you click the button, write the value of the text field to the `#response` div. You can write this in pure JS if you like, but Jquery is included so can be used.

# When finished

* Create a pull request.
